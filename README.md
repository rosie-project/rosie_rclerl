# ROS Client Library in Erlang

Prototype for a ROS2 implementation in pure Erlang.

## Requirements:
    Erlang OTP 23 as minimum
    ROS2 galactic


Note: 
The current implementation has only been tested against Cyclone-dds.
If you are using a different middleware for ROS2 you could experience crashes.
